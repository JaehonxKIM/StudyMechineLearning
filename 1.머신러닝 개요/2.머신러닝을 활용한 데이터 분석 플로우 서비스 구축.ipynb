Doty\\'s memoir Into the Magic Shop.[274] Their 2019 album, Map of the Soul: Persona gained its name from Murray Stein\\'s Jung\\'s Map of the Soul: An Introduction.[275]\\n BTS co-write and produce much of their own output.[276][277] Since their inception, BTS have had an emphasis on hip hop as their musical base largely due to the influence of RM and Suga\\'s background as underground rappers[12] and their main producer Pdogg.[278] Rather than adhering to a specific genre, BTS have introduced new elements into their sound and musical repertoire with each successive release.[279][280][281] Beginning with old-school hip hop on 2 Cool 4 Skool and O!RUL8,2? in 2013,[21] BTS first experimented with R&B and rock on Skool Luv Affair and Dark & Wild in 2014;[282][40] orchestral strings and EDM in their The Most Beautiful Moment in Life album series (2015–16);[54] moombahton, neo soul, and gospel on Wings (2016) and You Never Walk Alone (2017);[283][68] future bass, Latin pop, and jazz hip hop in their Love Yourself album series (2017–18);[85] emo rap, rap rock, Afro pop, nu-disco, funk, trap, pop rock and pop rap in their Map of the Soul album series (2019–20);[284][285][286][287][288] and dance-pop and disco in their singles \"Dynamite\", \"Butter\", and \"Permission to Dance\" (2020–21).[289][290]\\n \\nSince their inception, BTS have believed that telling their story is the best way for the younger generation to relate to their music.[291] Writing the majority of their own lyrics,[276][277] the group incorporates universal life experiences, such as sadness and loneliness, in their work and turn them into something more light and manageable. RM has stated that BTS tries to not sound as if they are preaching or reprimanding people in their songs, \"...because that\\'s not the way that we want to spread our message. [...] We\\'re born with different lives, but you cannot choose some things. So we thought that love, the real meaning of it, starts with loving ourselves and accepting some ironies and some destinies that we have from the very start\".[292] When asked if it is difficult to write about things like mental health, Suga responded, We feel that people who have the platform to talk about those things really should talk more, because they say depression is something where you go to the hospital and you\\'re diagnosed, but you can\\'t really know until the doctor talks to you. [...] More and more, I think artists or celebrities who have a voice should talk about these problems and bring it up to the surface.[293] The lyrical themes explored in the songs and albums of BTS have included diverse themes such as the issues of social identity in youth, anxieties of school-age youth, and mental health in youth culture.[10] According to a 2017 analysis by Billboard magazine, BTS\\' albums contain recurring youth-related themes.[10] Their \"school trilogy\" from 2013 to 2014 explored \"the troubles and anxieties of school-age youth.\"[294] In 2016, their approach to discussing youth culture issues in South Korea \"tackled a subject that the vast majority of youth experience, but few pop musicians articulate well: mental health and the desire to belong in society.\"[294] Wings (2016) focused on temptation and sin.[295] The \"Love Yourself\" series introduced various themes dealing with youth culture in South Korea including the excitement of love, the pains of farewell, and the enlightenment of self-love.[296] Their lyrics, which often include social commentary and criticisms of the interaction of South Korean youth culture with South Korean society, clearly reflect these.\"[294]\\n In 2018, songs such as \"No More Dream\" and \"N.O\" from their school trilogy were described by Tamar Herman as being motivated by their experiences with South Korea\\'s emphasis on education and called for change to the education system and societal expectations.[297] Their experiences with youth culture in South Korea inspired the songs \"Dope\" and \"Silver Spoon\" (Korean:\\xa0뱁새; RR:\\xa0Baepsae) from their youth trilogy, referencing generational disparity and millennials giving up of romantic relationships, marriage, children, proper employment, homes, and social life in the face of economic difficulties and societal ills while facing condemnation from the media and older generations.[297]\\n \"Am I Wrong\" from Wings (2016) questioned societal apathy towards the state of current events—the lyric \"We\\'re all dogs and pigs / we become dogs because we\\'re angry\" referenced the South Korean Ministry of Education official Na Hyang-wook, who was a proponent of the caste system and described the average person as \"dogs and pigs\", and BTS performed the song on television during the 2016 South Korean political scandal that led to the impeachment of ex-President Park Geun-hye.[297] RM and Suga\\'s personal struggles with mental health inspired songs like \"Tomorrow\", \"Intro: The Most Beautiful Moment in Life\", \"So Far Away\", \"The Last\", and \"Forever Rain.\"[298][299] \"Not Today\" from You Never Walk Alone (2017) is an anti-establishment anthem, with messages advocating for minority groups,[300] while \"Spring Day\" honored the victims of the Sewol Ferry tragedy.[301] BTS have been praised for \"speak[ing] honestly about topics they deem important, even in a conservative society\" by Jeff Benjamin in Fuse magazine.[302] South Korean president Moon Jae-in recognized their sincerity and inclusion of diversity as key to their success, writing, \"Each of the seven members sings in a way that is true to himself and the life he wants to live. Their melody and lyrics transcend regional borders, language, culture, and institutions.\"[303]\\n On April 29, 2019 Time magazine named BTS on their \"The 100 Most Influential People\" of the year list, giving them the nickname \"Princes of Pop\".[304] Billboard executive Silvio Pietroluongo compared BTS\\' commercial success and influence to that of the Beatles and the Monkees.[305] MRC Data executive Helena Kosinski noted that \"although BTS weren\\'t the first to open the doors to K-Pop worldwide, they were the first to become mainstream. They don\\'t just appeal to young people but also to the 50s and 60s age demographic\".[306] As the first non-English speaking artist to make the Global Artist Chart in 2018, BTS had the second and third best-selling albums worldwide and were the second best-selling artists worldwide across multiple media platforms, second only to Drake.[307][308][309] In 2020, BTS became the first non-western and non-English speaking artist to be named IFPI\\'s Global Recording Artist of the Year.[242] In South Korea, BTS accounted for 41.9 percent of album sales in the first half of 2019, up from their market share of 25.3 percent the previous year.[310]\\n The group\\'s influence has led them to address the 73rd United Nations General Assembly[311][312] and perform before 400 officials, including South Korean president Moon Jae-in, at the 2018 Korea-France Friendship Concert in Paris, a summit celebrating the friendly relations between France and South Korea.[313] That year, BTS also became the youngest ever recipients of the Order of Cultural Merit. Despite cultural medals traditionally being given to recipients with over 15 years of notable achievements, President Moon recognized the group, five years into their career, for their contributions in spreading Korean culture and language worldwide.[314][315] In September 2019, BTS were mentioned by President Moon in his announcement for his \"3 major innovation strategies for the contents industry\" for having pioneered innovative business models that communicate directly with fans.[316] In 2020, BTS were bestowed the James A. Van Fleet Award in recognition of their outstanding contributions to the promotion of US-Korea relations; to date, they are the youngest honorees and only musicians to receive the award in its history.[317] In July 2021, they were appointed Special Presidential Envoy for Future Generations and Culture by President Moon. In their role as envoys, they help to \"raise awareness on global agendas, such as sustainable development, to our future generations and to strengthen the nation\\'s diplomatic power across the world\"[318] and represent South Korea at various international events, such as the 76th United Nations General Assembly.[319]\\n BTS have maintained numerous global endorsement deals in various industries throughout their career.
